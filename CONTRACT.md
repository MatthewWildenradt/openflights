### Team Contract (padhi3-miw3-jorteg38-wpark26)

#### Communication
1. **Team Meetings**
Our team will meet once a week on Monday from 12 PM using Zoom. Team meetings should last no longer than an hour. miw3 will take notes and they will stored in a shared Google Drive. The team will decide on the goals that need to be completed by the end of the week and resolve any blocking issues that came up over the course of the previous week.

2. **Assistance**
Team members will primarily communicate through Discord. Members should respond to Discord messages within the day. Members also have their team members phone numbers and will be texted if there is an urgent question or a delay in responses.

3. **Respect**
Every member of the team will communicate during the meetings and will respond promptly on Discord. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering
to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

#### Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution**
Each week the team will decide on the deliverable for the week. Everyone will volunteer for a deliverable and estimate the time required for that deliverable. If there are no volunteers, two members will be assigned randomly. If there is too much work for a deliverable we will adjust on a case by case basis.

2. **Time Commitment**
Each member should work no more than 6 hours a week. If a deliverable takes more time, the other team members will attempt to help complete that deliverable within the week. If that is not possible, the deliverable will be pushed to the next week. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

3. **Conflict Resolution**
Conflicts will generally be resolved by the team members who are not involved in the conflict. If this is not sufficient, course staff can be contacted.
